Moodle Activity Module which enables SSO from Moodle to People Alchemy's Alchemy Assistant platform.


# What is People Alchemy
The Alchemy Assistant is a breakthrough support resource that provides day-by-day support on every area of workplace learning.

The premise is simple – most of us need the relevant knowledge and skill to do our jobs. More’s the pity, we can’t ever know it all. Alchemy Assistant provides practical, down to earth information and actual methods that everyone in your organisation can access right on-the-job, right when they need it. One user called it ‘roll up your sleeves information that helps gets the job done’.

This isn’t about learning modules. This is about bottom line, functional answers, advice, strategies, tools and methods that can be put into use every day to immediately achieve better, and more rapid results.
